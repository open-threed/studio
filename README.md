# ThreeD Studio
Build truly beautiful experiences on the web!

Threed Studio is a 3D animation editor with a set of design, lighting and motion tools. It helps you create any 3D scene, from a simple product presentation to a complete game made with Three.js.

Feel free to contribute or inspire yourself to build something out of it.

<br />

## Project
The goal is to incorporate all the editing capabilities provided by Three.js and its ecosystem into the editor's interface, granting users the freedom to accomplish practically everything they would be able to do if they were directly coding with this technology.

The product ought to have the capability to construct any 3D experiences on the web, leveraging Three.js exclusively for this purpose. I believe it would be splendid to fully harness the 3D modeling potential offered by this technology and bestow that very same power upon users through the editor tools.

Moreover, we aim to implement certain functionalities that streamline the creation of more complex things, such as character control in a third-person game or even scroll-based animations, ideal for crafting websites and web presentations.

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the threed-studio repository](http://docs.threed.world/docs/contribute/working-in-studio-repository). For more information on how we use our code patterns, see [the threed-studio code pattern reference](http://docs.threed.world/docs/contribute/code-pattern-reference).

Check to see what [types of contributions](http://docs.threed.world/docs/contribute/types-of-contributions) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code.

<br />

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/open-threed/studio/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/open-threed/studio/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

<br />

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes.
3. Commit your update and create a pull request for a review.

<br />

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

<br />

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Open ThreeD team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the PR. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
